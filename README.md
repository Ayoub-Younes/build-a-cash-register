# Cash Register Project

This is a Cash Register project created as part of my JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification from FreeCodeCamp. The project simulates a cash register that calculates the change due to a customer based on the price of an item and the cash provided by the customer.

## Project Overview

The Cash Register allows users to input the cash received from a customer and determines the change due, if any, based on the item price. The webpage displays the status of the cash drawer as either "OPEN," "CLOSED," or "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS." It features a visually appealing design with custom fonts, a background image, and interactive elements. The project also focuses on client-side input validation and cash register logic.
